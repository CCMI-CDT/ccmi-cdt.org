  - "Within my project, I am developing robust multi-fidelity, multi-objective Bayesian inference methods for the optimisation of image-based sensor placement in fusion validation experiments. These
optimisations will use a multi-physics simulation as input and output an array of image-based diagnostics and their positions along with predicted measurement uncertainties."
