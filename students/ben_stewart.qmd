info:
  - "Ben is a PhD student in the Computational Optimisation Group at Imperial College London, focusing on probabilistic machine learning for dynamic systems (initially Neural ODEs) with downstream applications to chemical experiment design - including small molecule synthesis and small-scale biomanufacturing - in collaboration with Merck & Co. He is passionate about accelerating scientific discovery through data-driven and physics-driven computational models. He holds an MSc in Chemistry from the University of York, which included a year of research in the University of Sydney’s quantum computing lab."
