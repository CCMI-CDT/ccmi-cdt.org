### Application Procedure

You apply by submitting a written application in our online submission system. If shortlisted this is followed by a formal interview. If you pass the interview we will match you with a suitable research project before a formal offer is made. Details can be found [here](application_procedure.qmd).

### PhD Projects

We offer [PhD projects](phd_projects/phd_project_list.qmd) across a broad range of technical areas from UCL and Imperial College. The common thread of these projects is the relevance to modern computational and data sciences. As part of the application procedure you will be matched with a suitable PhD Project and associated supervisor. Some PhD projects may involve external partners and expected internships at the external partner institutions. Such additional requirements are specified within the project descriptions.

### Eligibility and language requirements.

A UK Master's degree in a relevant discipline with Merit, or a minimum of an upper second-class UK Bachelor's degree in a relevant discipline, or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard. Work experience may also be taken into account. The required English level for this Programme is [Level 1](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/english-language-requirements).

Relevant disciplines are broadly STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). But other related disciplines on the interface to STEM may be suitable too. During the application stage we will assess the suitability of your technical background.
