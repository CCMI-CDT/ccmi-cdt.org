  summary: "A networking opportunity to discuss collaborative research projects between UKAEA and the CCMI CDT."
  description: "Fusion research is a complex multidisciplinary problem, ranging across fundamental science,
                engineering, computational modelling, and the data sciences. In this network event we discuss
                future collaborations between the CCMI CDT and UKAEA on the interface of exciting computational
                modelling problems, large-scale data science and AI, and cutting edge research software engineering."
