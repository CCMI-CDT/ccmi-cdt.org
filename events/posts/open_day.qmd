On 13 November we will organise an open day from 3pm to 4:30pm GMT. This will be an online event where you can meet the CDT team,
get to know our research, talk to current PhD students from UCL and Imperial and ask questions about the application process.

If you want to take part please fill out our [CDT registration form](https://forms.office.com/e/i2jpkQu0Lm). No need to fill it out again
if you have already registered your interest in the CDT.


We will send out online joining links to registered participants two days before the event.

We are looking forward to meeting you!
