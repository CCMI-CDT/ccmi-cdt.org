On Monday 1 October our first training week is starting. Students will get to know programming models
for Scientific Computing through a mixture of lectures, student led seminars and practical programming sessions.
Topics parallel programming models, GPU development and software libraries for mathematical tasks.
On the final day we look forward to a guest lecture by [Chris Richardson](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/directory/chris-richardson) from Cambridge on [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org).
