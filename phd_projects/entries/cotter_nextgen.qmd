## Project Description

The classical numerical approaches to building atmosphere models rely
on complicated splitting methods that deal with different parts of the
model: waves, transport, moisture processes (clouds, evaporation,
rain, ice etc), radiation, boundary layers, convection, etc. These
splitting methods lead to highly complicated codes, time schemes that
are difficult to analyse for stability/accuracy, and occasionally
numerical artifacts the coupling of fluid dynamics and other physics.
In this project we are pursuing an alternative goal: to translate as
much of the system as possible into a single monolithic PDE coupling
all the variables, and solve it with an implicit Runge-Kutta method.
This is made possible by recent advances in massively parallel
iterative methods for solving the implicit systems that come from this
equation: we shift the complications from the timestepping scheme into
the iterative solver.

As a first step, we will build an atmosphere model consisting of the
fluid dynamics component plus moisture processes, in this framework.
Moisture processes involve switches (e.g., when maximum humidity is
reached, any surplus water vapour is converted into cloud); we will
deal with this using advanced "Variational Inequality" Newton solvers
facilitated using PETSc [1].  The spatial discretisation will be build
from compatible finite element methods closely related to those being
implemented in the next generation LFRic modelling system at the Met
Office. The software will be developed using Firedrake [2], which is a
system for solving complicated PDEs using advanced finite element
methods based on domain specific languages and code generation.

The resulting modelling system will be automatically differentiable
using the py-adjoint system
(https://github.com/dolfin-adjoint/pyadjoint), making it suitable for
blending with machine learning tools, towards our goal of hybrid
physics-based/data-driven modelling approaches.

### Main objectives of the project

This project is available to researchers with a wide variety
of interests, who might focus on one or more of:
* designing scalable iterative methods allowing the use of highly parallel
supercomputers,
* developing interative solvers that seamlessly incorporate moisture
processes,
* developing stabilisation schemes that allow the model to incorporate
the effects of unresolved turbulent scales,
* time-parallel algorithms using ParaDiag methods [5],
* benchmarking the quality of the simulation in challenging testcases
  such as fronts and storms,
* exploration of computationally optimal configurations using e.g.
high order discretisations and emergent Firedrake capability on GPUs.
