## Project Description

### Existing background work

Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, with applications in image, audio, and 3D synthesis. This PhD project aims to advance the computational efficiency of diffusion models by addressing two primary challenges: expensive time integration during sampling and the curse of dimensionality in data representation. We propose to develop novel scientific computing methods combining advanced time integration schemes with high-dimensional approximation techniques. This interdisciplinary approach will bridge state-of-the-art generative AI with classical numerical analysis and modern tensor approximation methods, potentially unlocking major efficiency gains while maintaining or improving generation quality.

### Existing background work
Recent advancements in diffusion model sampling have focused on either improving time integration or tackling high-dimensional representations. On the time integration front, methods like DPM-Solver and DEIS have leveraged exponential integrators and sophisticated ODE solvers. For high-dimensional approximation, techniques such as tensor decompositions and sparse grids have shown promise in related fields. However, there remains a significant gap in approaches that effectively combine these two aspects for diffusion models. This project builds upon these foundations while aiming to create a unified framework that addresses both challenges simultaneously.

### Main objectives of the project

The primary objectives of this project are to: (1) Develop novel time integration schemes tailored for diffusion model ODEs/SDEs, incorporating adaptive stepping and error control. (2) Investigate high-dimensional approximation techniques, including tensor decompositions and sparse grids, for efficient representation of diffusion model states and operators. (3) Design algorithms that combine advanced time integration with high-dimensional approximation, including multi-level and multi-fidelity approaches. (4) Conduct rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed methods, deriving stability conditions, convergence rates, and error bounds.

### Details of Software/Data Deliverables
The project will produce a suite of scientific computing algorithms specifically designed for diffusion models. These will include novel time integration schemes, high-dimensional approximation techniques, and hybrid methods that combine both approaches. The algorithms will be built with a focus on both scalability to large-scale diffusion models and modularity, enabling easy integration with existing diffusion model implementations.
