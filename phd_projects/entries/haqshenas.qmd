## Project Description

### Existing background work

The supervisory team, together with Dr van â€™t Wout, has been developing the open-source
Python library OptimUS for solving acoustic wave propagation in an unbounded medium in 3D
with piecewise homogeneous domains. OptimUS solves the Helmholtz equation using the
boundary element method (BEM). It has been used to simulate biomedical ultrasound clinical
scenarios relating to treating cancers of the liver and kidney, as well as osteoid osteoma.
OptimUS featured as part of an international software benchmarking exercise for ultrasound
transcranial neuromodulation, overseen by the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation
Safety and Standards. The OptimUS library is being used in biomedical ultrasound research in
academic affiliations worldwide as well as a pedagogical tool for undergraduate and
postgraduate students.
The current BEM formulations in OptimUS assume that domains exhibit fluid-like properties. This
gives us accurate prediction of ultrasound propagation in soft tissues (e.g. the liver and kidney).
However, hard tissues like bones and many dense cancer tumours demonstrate solid-like (elastic)
behaviour. This creates a gap in accurately modelling ultrasound propagation in domains with a
mix of soft and hard tissues and underscores the need for BEM formulations that represent the
physics more accurately.

OptimUS leverages the BEMpp kernel developed by Prof Betcke in UCL. Prof Chaillat (from
ENSTA, Paris, France) is an expert in modelling wave propagation in elastic domains using BEM.
She is the main developer of COFFEE, which is a code for solving elastic BEM in separated
domains. The supervisory team and the external partners will offer academic mentorship,
educational support and access to the state-of-the-art medical imaging and computational
facilities (high-performance computing workstations as well as the UCL Research Computing
Platforms Service) required for the successful delivery of this project.

### Main objectives of the project

This project aims to develop an efficient BEM formulation for solving ultrasound wave
propagation in mixed domains of soft and hard tissues (i.e., both fluid and elastic domains). The
BEM approach uses Green's functions, which are inherently complex in elastic problems. Also, the
equations become ill-conditioned at high frequencies, substantially deteriorating the
performance of the solver. To address these challenges, a novel formulation based on the
Helmholtz transform will be introduced, building on the team's previous works in solving the
Helmholtz and Maxwell equations. The new formulation will be implemented in the OptimUS
software, validated against analytical solutions for canonical geometries, and tested in
simulations of ultrasound wave propagation through the human body using anatomical models
derived from medical images (ultrasound/MRI/CT scans).
The successful completion of this project will have significant implications for the field of
biomedical ultrasound, particularly in treatment planning for procedures like focused ultrasound
therapy as well as imaging applications such as shear wave elastography. By improving the
accuracy and efficiency of simulations, this work will enhance OptimUS and facilitate its adoption
in clinical settings, where it could be used for personalised treatment, ultimately improving
patient outcomes.


### Details of Software/Data deliverables

The project involves implementing, testing and optimising the computational performance of the
new BEM formulation for solving ultrasound waves in complex viscous and elastic domains. The
student will be actively involved in software development using Python and employing best
practices in software carpentry including version control with Git and automated testing to
ensure code reliability and reproducibility. The outcome of this project will impact the field of
biomedical ultrasound, specifically for treatment planning, and facilitate the uptake of OptimUS
in clinics.
