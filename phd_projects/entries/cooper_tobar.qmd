## Project Description

The development of advanced materials for nuclear energy systems requires complex experimental campaigns involving significant time and resource investments. Current approaches rely heavily on manual planning by experts, limiting scalability and adaptability. This project aims to revolutionize experimental design in nuclear materials research by leveraging foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), to guide and optimize the scientific process.

1.  Mathematical Foundations
The project will develop a computational framework grounded in mathematical optimization techniques such as Bayesian inference, active learning, and probabilistic modelling. These methods will enable efficient experiment design by integrating prior scientific knowledge, evaluating uncertainties, and recommending optimal experimental strategies. Mathematical rigor will ensure the scalability and robustness of the approach.

2.  Computational Modelling
The project will explore cutting-edge AI and computational modelling approaches, including deep learning architectures specialized for scientific data. Foundation models will extract relevant information from large datasets, generate hypotheses, and simulate experimental scenarios. Integration with nuclear materials models will allow for the realistic prediction of material behaviours under extreme conditions such as radiation exposure.

3.  Real-World Applications
Close collaboration with the UK Atomic Energy Agency will align the project with nuclear materials research challenges, focusing on irradiation-resistant materials, fusion reactor components, and other mission-critical materials. The framework will be validated using experimental datasets from real-world research projects, ensuring that AI-driven experimental designs translate into tangible advances in nuclear materials science.

This interdisciplinary project bridges artificial intelligence, materials science, and nuclear research. The successful PhD candidate will gain expertise in advanced AI methods, materials characterization, and scientific data analysis, preparing them for leading roles in academia or industry. By advancing experimental design optimization, the project will accelerate discovery while reducing the time and cost associated with nuclear materials research.


### Existing background work

The design of experiments in nuclear materials research is
challenging due to the high costs, safety-critical constraints,
and the complexity of data-driven insights required. Traditional
methods rely on expert-driven approaches supported by
computational models, but these are often resource-intensive and
difficult to scale.

Recent advances in AI, particularly large language models, offer
promising solutions for optimizing experimental campaigns. These
models excel at processing scientific literature, proposing
hypotheses, and guiding experiment design. Sam Cooper's group has
demonstrated the potential of AI for materials science in automating
microstructure optimization using generative models [1]. However,
integrating such models into experiment design for nuclear research
remains underexplored.

Felipe Tobar's group has made key contributions in Bayesian
model selection [2] and Gaussian processes, which are essential
for managing uncertainty in experimental design from the lens of
Bayesian optimisation. Combining these methods with LLM-driven
scientific reasoning could create a powerful system for
optimizing nuclear materials experiments, particularly in
designing irradiation-resistant materials and fusion reactor
components.

This project aims to merge AI-driven language models,
probabilistic inference, and computational materials simulations
into a unified framework for experiment planning. By leveraging
expertise from both groups and collaborating with the UK Atomic
Energy Agency, the project seeks to accelerate nuclear materials
research through scalable, data-driven experimental design.
