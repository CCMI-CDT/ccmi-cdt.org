## Project Description

We would like to offer an interdisciplinary PhD project at the
Department of Mathematics and the Centre for Higher Education Research
and Scholarship. Ultimately, the research conducted by the student
will address complex topics in education while leveraging mathematical
methodologies to offer insights with real-world implications for
policy and practice. We will thus focus on understanding what drives
inequities in STEM and related careers, including gender equity. We
will address the topic using mixed approaches with a strong
quantitative outlook. This will include mathematical modelling to
explore fundamental aspects of learning or decision-making through
agent-based models. The agent-based models will be complemented and
informed by simpler mathematical models and by using Bayesian
statistics and machine-learning methods applied to real-world
data. This will include existing large national datasets, such as the
Administrative Data Research UK (ADR UK,
https://www.adruk.org/data-access/data-catalogue/) catalogue and
flagship datasets
(https://www.adruk.org/data-access/flagship-datasets/). Beyond a
literature search, an exploration of existing data will thus be an
essential starting point for tailoring the modelling approach.

### Existing background work 

Mathematical models of learning and cognition are widespread in
computational psychology and educational research. Thus, agent-based
models have been applied to simulate and understand the underlying
behavioural dynamics for a wide range of phenomena in social science
(e.g., https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.16.599026v1,
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/andp.202100277),
including gender equity
(https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.221346), and
recently agent-based models using large language models have emerged
as a new and fruitful avenue (e.g.,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442). Agent-based models are thus the
ideal tool to explore how the decisions of individuals lead to
emergent properties on a societal level. The behaviour of larger
populations, on the other hand, can be modelled, e.g., using diffusion
decision models or other game-theoretical concepts.

In general, quantitative methods, including advanced statistical
analyses, play a fundamental role in educational research. Integrating
quantitative approaches with qualitative methods thus offers a robust
methodology in the field and a more comprehensive understanding of
educational phenomena.

Dr Andreas Joergensen has a strong background in developing and
applying mechanistic models, such as agent-based models, across a wide
range of fields, including astrophysics, biology, and environmental
conservation. Moreover, he has combined these models with Bayesian
inference and machine-learning frameworks to successfully use them to
shed light on real-world data. His interdisciplinary expertise will
support the application of these techniques to educational
research. Additionally, Professor Camille Kandiko Howson brings
extensive expertise in educational research, including the development
and analysis of national student surveys and measures of educational
quality and learning gain; large-scale research into educational
inequalities in Physics and wider Physics Education Research; and
research on applied methods for learning analytics. Together, they
have previously explored synergies between mathematics and education,
particularly through a project proposal on gender equity at Imperial,
which will flow into the PhD project.

### Main objectives of the project

This project aims to apply quantitative and computational methods to
address complex challenges in education research, with a specific
focus on inequities in STEM fields. The goal is to derive actionable
insights that can influence educational policies and practices. While
large-scale patterns of engagement and inequality in education are
often tracked through national datasets, many researchers lack the
computational expertise to analyse this data or to model the
underlying dynamics. This project, therefore, seeks to bridge that gap
by developing computational methodologies that connect and analyse
mathematical models, addressing previously unexplored aspects of
existing data.

The agent-based models in this project will be tailored to inform
policies and practices, leveraging an understanding of the current
data landscape. This includes identifying suitable proxies for
inequity, such as degree progression, career outcomes, and academic
performance in higher education. Additionally, useful summary
statistics and underlying mechanisms will be incorporated to ensure
the modelâ€™s relevance to real-world scenarios.

The agent-based models will be built on Bayesian principles, allowing
them to capture how individuals interact with social information and
navigate complex environments. By exploring the impact of different
model parameters, we aim to uncover the mechanisms driving emergent
social phenomena. Furthermore, surrogate models, such as emulators or
simplifying approximations, will be introduced to enable comparisons
with real-world data using Bayesian inference.

### Details of Software/Data Deliverables

The student will be responsible for developing the code necessary for
the project. This will include mathematical models to simulate
educational processes, but it will also entail the code needed for
incorporating and dealing with real-world data. All code developed
during the project should adhere to best practices in open science and
be made publicly available upon publication to ensure transparency and
facilitate future research. This will allow the broader scientific
community to benefit from the tools and methodologies created during
the PhD project.
