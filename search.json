    "title": "PARALIFT – A PARAllel framework for LIFTed training of neural networks",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This project is founded on innovative advancements in distributed neural network training. The cornerstone of this work, as proposed in [1], is a framework for the distributed training of deep neural networks innovatively replaces the traditional neural network consistency constraint with quadratic penalisations of that constraint. These quadratic penalisations have the advantage that they remove the need for back-propagation and pave the way for distributed optimisation algorithms that can distribute the training of individual layers across different workers. At the same time, the framework requires the introduction of auxiliary variables, which lifts the parameter search space into a higher dimensional space. This framework has subsequently been augmented by constraining the auxiliary variables to convex sets [2], and its quadratic penalties have been replaced with more bespoke penalty functions [3, 4]. In [4], the penalty functions have been replaced with tailored Bregman distance functions that, in combination with suitable optimisation algorithms, bypass the requirement of differentiating activation functions in the process. Building on this foundation, the lifted Bregman framework has been effectively applied to address the inverse problem in neural networks [5]. The objective here is to deduce the input of a pre-trained network from its output. In [6], the proposed framework has also been shown to be an effective tool for the computation of source condition elements, which are important quantities in the context of inverse problems. Furthermore, the method therein has been adapted to efficiently compute optimal sampling patterns for magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n\n\nWhile the background work has showcased the versatility of the quadratic penalisation and lifted Bregman methods in smaller-scale applications, their full potential in distributed neural network training remains largely untapped. This project aims to tap this potential by democratising access to the distributed lifted Bregman framework for the broader research community. The main objective is to develop a user-friendly software toolbox, designed to simplify the implementation of deep neural network training for large-scale datasets using the lifted Bregman framework. This toolbox will be as straightforward to use as existing toolboxes like PyTorch or JAX. A key advantage of this new toolbox is its capacity for massive parallelisation, enabling the distribution of parameter updates across various workers for individual layers, while concurrently avoiding the need for differentiating non-differentiable operations.\nThe specific main objectives of this PhD project include (but are not limited to): - Developing a Comprehensive Software Toolbox: Creating an efficient and effective toolbox for implementing the lifted Bregman framework, tailored to both ease of use and high performance. - Advancing Medical Imaging Techniques: Applying this innovative framework to medical imaging applications, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), for large-scale datasets. - Enhancing Variational Regularisations: Focusing on the training of variational regularisations with optimal source condition elements as a novel use-case. - Inverting Deep Neural Networks: Employing the lifted Bregman inversion framework for the challenging task of inverting deep neural networks, particularly in contexts involving large-scale datasets.\n\n\n\nThis project is designed to propel the use of the lifted Bregman framework from its current state with limited use cases to mass adoption. To do so, the project involves the development a Python library or Julia package (depending on the candidate’s prior programming experience and skillset) for distributed optimisation of the lifted Bregman objectives. The goal of this library or package is to make it as easy setting up complex use cases, e.g. the training of very deep transformer-based neural network architectures for large-scale datasets, as it currently is in popular automatic differentiation/deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and JAX, but to efficiently utilise distributed training routines tailored to the lifted Bregman framework without users having to implement any of this functionality manually. In particular, the library or package will - allow users to set up a wide range of different and versatile architectures and optimisation problems. - support popular training techniques, such as batch normalisation. - feature a variety of different distributed, non-smooth optimisation routines, including distributed proximal gradient descent, proximal incremental aggregated gradient, and proximal stochastic averaged gradient. - utilise distributed hardware architectures with little to no user input to enable both data and layer parallelism.\nThis project aims to elevate the lifted Bregman framework from its current state of limited use-cases to widespread use in the research community. Central to this objective is the development of either a Python library or a Julia package, depending on the candidate’s programming expertise and skills. This tool will facilitate distributed optimisation of lifted Bregman objectives, making the setup of complex scenarios as effortless as using established automatic differentiation and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and JAX. However, it uniquely focuses on the efficient employment of distributed training routines specific to the lifted Bregman framework, all without requiring users having to engage with the intricate details of manual implementation. Key features of this library or package include (but are not limited to): - Versatile Architecture and Optimisation Setup: Enabling users to effortlessly configure a broad spectrum of deep neural network architectures, loss functions, constraints, and optimisation problems. - Support for Established Training Techniques: Incorporating widely used training methodologies, including batch normalisation, to ensure compatibility with current best practices. - Advanced Distributed Optimisation Routines: Offering an array of sophisticated distributed, non-smooth optimisation techniques, such as distributed proximal gradient descent, proximal incremental aggregated gradient, and proximal stochastic averaged gradient. - Optimized Utilisation of Distributed Hardware: Designed to leverage distributed hardware architectures with minimal user intervention, thereby facilitating both data and layer parallelism for enhanced computational efficiency.\nReferences - [1] Miguel Carreira-Perpinan, and Weiran Wang. “Distributed optimization of deeply nested systems.” PMLR, 2014. - [2] Armin Askari, et al. “Lifted neural networks.” arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.01532 (2018). - [3] Fangda Gu, Armin Askari, and Laurent El Ghaoui. “Fenchel lifted networks: A Lagrange relaxation of neural network training.” PMLR, 2020. - [4] Xiaoyu Wang, and Martin Benning. “Lifted Bregman training of neural networks.” Journal of Machine Learning Research 24, no. 232 (2023): 1-51. - [5] Xiaoyu Wang, and Martin Benning. “A lifted Bregman formulation for the inversion of deep neural networks.” Frontiers in Applied Mathematics and Statistics 9 (2023): 1176850. - [6] Martin Benning, Tatiana A.

This will include first working on general optimisation problems and developing a methodology to solve optimisation problems using generative models, most notably, diffusion and flow models (but also potentially others). Once the methodology is developed, the methodology will be converted to a software package (written in JAX, as envisioned), properly documented, and aimed at general use. To improve then the usability of the software, we will incorporate physical constraints as ready-to-go functions which can be made to guide generative models.\n\n\n\nWe aim at interfacing popular diffusion and flow model code (or incorporating into ours) with general purpose optimizers (again, can be modified) and PDE solvers. My earlier project as cited above [1] produced a mini software package, called DiffusionJAX: https://github.com/bb515/diffusionjax Further developments of this will be implementing general purpose optimisation methods as well as PDE solvers, such as the ones based on finite elements (see the relevant projects I worked in [5], [6] and software output: https://github.com/connor-duffin/ula-statfem).

Metropolis sampling for constrained diffusion models. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36.\nI have worked on diffusion models for inverse problems [1], which is a special case of constraining the generative model (instead of a loss function, one uses a likelihood – where the log-likelihood can be interpreted as a loss function). This worked really well for inverse problems, and we are already working on extensions of this idea using sequential Monte Carlo within my group for inverse problems as well as for general losses. Other relevant works include variational deep generative modelling with physics constraints, which can be seen from [2, 3, 4].\n[1] Boys, B., Girolami, M., Pidstrigach, J., Reich, S., Mosca, A. and Akyildiz, O.D., 2023.

This will include first working on general optimisation problems and developing a methodology to solve optimisation problems using generative models, most notably, diffusion and flow models (but also potentially others). Once the methodology is developed, the methodology will be converted to a software package (written in JAX, as envisioned), properly documented, and aimed at general use. To improve then the usability of the software, we will incorporate physical constraints as ready-to-go functions which can be made to guide generative models.\n\n\n\nWe aim at interfacing popular diffusion and flow model code (or incorporating into ours) with general purpose optimizers (again, can be modified) and PDE solvers. My earlier project as cited above [1] produced a mini software package, called DiffusionJAX: https://github.com/bb515/diffusionjax Further developments of this will be implementing general purpose optimisation methods as well as PDE solvers, such as the ones based on finite elements (see the relevant projects I worked in [5], [6] and software output: https://github.com/connor-duffin/ula-statfem). The final aim is to combine the strengths of the JAX and available generative modelling and scientific modelling code, combined into a coherent framework to work with the problem of generating data with complicated constraints that arise in real-world modelling.\n[5] Akyildiz, Ö.D., Duffin, C., Sabanis, S. and Girolami, M., 2022.

    "title": "Smart Image-Based Sensor Optimisation for Fusion Simulation Validation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Fusion components need to sustain continuous extreme loads including: Steady state heat fluxes up to 20 MW/m2; strong local magnetic fields on the order of several Tesla imparting large Mega Newton body forces; and neutron bombardment leading to significant irradiation damage. The combination of extreme multi-physics conditions means that validation experiments are time and resource intensive, often yielding sparse data. Given that fusion component tests have a high cost in time and resources, a means of designing targeted and data-rich experiments that can be directly compared with engineering / physics simulations is highly desirable.\nCombining advances in image-based diagnostics and machine learning to optimise their use is a route to reducing the number of experiments required for fusion component qualification. Large scale component validation experiments on UKAEA’s CHIMERA and LIBRTI facilities will cost on the order of £M’s. This cost means it is not possible to run the number of experiments required for uncertainty quantification but it is possible to simulate millions of experiments and use this information to run a targeted experimental campaign. Additionally, the cost in time and resources means that gaining high-fidelity data from an optimised array of imaging sensors has the potential to greatly reduce the required experimental effort for simulation validation. To enable this, new simulation tools are required that can accurately model image-based sensors applied to a multi-physics simulation. Furthermore, while optimisation algorithms exist for points sensors applied to single physics applications there are currently no methods for optimising arrays of image-based sensors applied to a realistic multi-physics experiment.\n\n\nThis project will leverage the expertise of Dr Andrew Duncan in machine learning methods for model calibration, uncertainty quantification and sensor placement optimization for expensive computational simulations subject to budget constraints. The project will be co-supervised by Dr Dante Kalise, who has expertise in optimisation and optimal control of PDE driven systems. The student will be based at Imperial College London but will spend up to a month each year working on-site at either Culham or FTF-Yorkshire to enhance interaction with UKAEA staff.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this project is to develop a series of robust optimisation methods that can be used to design optimal image-based sensor arrays for multi-physics validation experiments. These optimisations will use a multi-physics simulation as input and output an array of image-based diagnostics and their positions along with predicted measurement uncertainties. The first objective of this project will be to enable multi-physics sensor placement optimisation with a focus on ray-tracing algorithms for simulating camera sensors combined with other sensors.

    "title": "Smart Image-Based Sensor Optimisation for Fusion Simulation Validation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Fusion components need to sustain continuous extreme loads including: Steady state heat fluxes up to 20 MW/m2; strong local magnetic fields on the order of several Tesla imparting large Mega Newton body forces; and neutron bombardment leading to significant irradiation damage. The combination of extreme multi-physics conditions means that validation experiments are time and resource intensive, often yielding sparse data. Given that fusion component tests have a high cost in time and resources, a means of designing targeted and data-rich experiments that can be directly compared with engineering / physics simulations is highly desirable.\nCombining advances in image-based diagnostics and machine learning to optimise their use is a route to reducing the number of experiments required for fusion component qualification. Large scale component validation experiments on UKAEA’s CHIMERA and LIBRTI facilities will cost on the order of £M’s. This cost means it is not possible to run the number of experiments required for uncertainty quantification but it is possible to simulate millions of experiments and use this information to run a targeted experimental campaign. Additionally, the cost in time and resources means that gaining high-fidelity data from an optimised array of imaging sensors has the potential to greatly reduce the required experimental effort for simulation validation. To enable this, new simulation tools are required that can accurately model image-based sensors applied to a multi-physics simulation. Furthermore, while optimisation algorithms exist for points sensors applied to single physics applications there are currently no methods for optimising arrays of image-based sensors applied to a realistic multi-physics experiment.\n\n\nThis project will leverage the expertise of Dr Andrew Duncan in machine learning methods for model calibration, uncertainty quantification and sensor placement optimization for expensive computational simulations subject to budget constraints. The project will be co-supervised by Dr Dante Kalise, who has expertise in optimisation and optimal control of PDE driven systems. The student will be based at Imperial College London but will spend up to a month each year working on-site at either Culham or FTF-Yorkshire to enhance interaction with UKAEA staff.\n\n\n\nThe aim of this project is to develop a series of robust optimisation methods that can be used to design optimal image-based sensor arrays for multi-physics validation experiments. These optimisations will use a multi-physics simulation as input and output an array of image-based diagnostics and their positions along with predicted measurement uncertainties. The first objective of this project will be to enable multi-physics sensor placement optimisation with a focus on ray-tracing algorithms for simulating camera sensors combined with other sensors. The second objective is to incorporate computationally efficient uncertainty propagation using machine learning and ensembles of multi-fidelity models. The third objective will be to develop explainable approaches to sensor placement, leveraging multi-objective optimization methods obtain provide a justification of what aspects of an experiment will be informed by a particular sensor, and the associated tradeoffs against competing objectives.

    "section": "",
    "text": "With the advent of high performance computing and new computer architectures there is renewed interest in the efficient coupling of different partial differential equation based models and their associated solvers. Indeed, it is often the case that for a given application or computational methods there exists a highly optimized solver. However in complex applications many different models are connected and it is then attractive to connect such optimized solvers for the subproblem to obtain a solution of the global problem. The common approach in this framework is to discretize the global continuous problem into a, possibly huge, algebraic system, and then split the latter as a system of coupled algebraic subsystems. In this case the coupling condition often consists in the identification of unknowns in the subsystems corresponding to the same global unknown. This approach forms the basis of the dominating coupling softwares available today (see for example [3,4]).\nAn alternative approach, which is lately gaining increasing interest, is, instead, to decompose the original problem already at the continuous/infinite dimensional level, thus obtaining a system of coupled infinite dimensional subproblems, to be successively discretized. The advantage of the latter approach compared to the former is that it allows for a detailed mathematical analysis of the resulting couplings under precise conditions on the local solvers. Moreover, it allows for the design of optimal preconditioners of the coupling method. An abstract framework for heterogeneous coupling including stability and error analysis as well as the design of preconditioners was recently proposed by the principal supervisor in [1]. It is shown that a variety of different couplings enter the framework including interface coupling, volume coupling, FEM-BEM coupling, bulk-surface pde systems, or networks of fractures. This theoretical work was inspired by the principal supervisors extensive work on coupling methods for heterogeneous interface problems [3], fluid-structure or fluid-fluid interaction [4,5], or FEM- BEM coupling [2,6].\n\n\n\nDescribe the main objectives of the project.\nThe main objective of the project is to further develop the ideas of [1] along the following lines:\n\nTheory. The examples of [1] are restricted to scalar problems. Here the objective of the thesis would be to show how the framework can be applied to systems, with special focus on the linearized Navier-Stokes’ equations of fluid mechanics and the Maxwell’s equations of electro magnetics. For these cases a complete analysis will be derived including stability and error analysis. Preconditioners for the coupling will also be designed. If time allows more heterogeneous systems will then be considered, such as for example free flow coupled to fractured porous media or magneto-hydrodynamics. Another more adventurous potential research strand is to explore using network approximation to learn optimal coupling spaces satisfying the conditions of [1].\nComputational aspects. The framework will then be realised in a computational software where the merits of different coupling conditions or formulations can be assessed. Here special care will be taken to make the computational software agnostic (to the furthest possible extent) to the solvers of the subproblems in the spirit of [1].\n\n\n\n\nThe software deliverable should form a significant component of the PhD project.

    "text": "Project Description\nThis project will study the equivariance of deep learning. The large majority of equivariant deep learning approaches is ad-hoc, and the direction of the PhD project is to exploit the algebraic theory of invariant and equivariant functions in a systematic way to develop a versatile and general approach to learning in the presence of symmetry. A few important tasks that can be achieved with such general theory are learning symmetry group orbits (e.g. recognizing objects, irrespective of their position or orientation), learning symmetry coordinates (e.g. the position and orientation of objects), and learning symmetries and near-symmetries (invariances and near-invariances).\n\n\nExisting background work\nEquivariant deep learning is a subfield of deep learning that deals explicitly with symmetry in datasets and models. One of the most well-known and successful example is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), used for the translation invariant machine learning of images. Equivariance is considered by many leading machine learners as one of the essential ingredients, explaining the remarkable leap in efficiency of deep learning models [1]. It is also an important ingredient in physics informed modelling. Our group has a long track record of understanding symmetry in dynamical systems and we are now translating this to machine learning.\n[1] M. Bronstein et al. Geometric deep learning. https://geometricdeeplearning.com\n\n\nMain objectives of the project\nThe project will develop a systematic approach to develop algorithms that merge (computer) algebra with optimisation strategies in deep learning settings. There are many areas of applications where equivariant deep learning is the intrinsic objective. The PhD project aims to develop algorithms and software to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mathematical methodology in a concrete applied setting.\n\n\nDetails of Software/Data Deliverables\nThe project will provide open source software enabling the implementation of equivariant learning strategies compatible with widely used deep learning frameworks."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Antibodies are proteins that play a key role in the immune response against pathogens by binding specifically to the pathogen. The body is able to modify sections of antibodies through mutations to improve the specificity and affinity of the binding to unseen pathogens. Consequently, the design of antibodies as possible therapeutic tools that can bind to specific targets (e.g., pathogens, cancerous cells) is an area of highly active research. However, which molecular and structural properties determine the specific binding of antibodies to protein targets remains unclear, thus hampering our understanding of the mutational effects in the immune response and impeding progress in the rational design of antibodies. In this project, we will develop machine learning methods to predict antibodies’ functional properties related to their binding that are informed by biophysical modelling of their sequence and structure as captured by graph-based representations of antibody-protein interactions. In particular, the aim of these models is to predict and characterize single-site mutations that can improve antibody binding to specific targets without compromising other biophysical properties, with potential applications in antibody design.\n\n\nTo achieve our main goal, we will leverage various machine learning approaches which we have developed, and we will develop new ones to exploit the increasing amount of data on antibodies and their cognate target proteins. Schematically, the objectives and tasks of the project will be:\n\nTo train a model that can capture long-range complex dependencies between amino acids at different sites along the antibody/protein amino acid chain, and which, accounting for such dependencies, can provide a single-site measure of amino acid importance to target binding. For this task we will build upon a transformer-like architecture [1].\nTo build biophysically informed models of antibody-protein interactions that can give graph representations of such interactions and antibody/protein structures, summarizing and distilling relevant biochemical and structural information. We will employ different graph construction techniques, from geometric graphs that capture packing to biophysical models of energetic interactions to higher-order models (akin to simplicial complexes) that capture many-body interactions in the structure. We will then explore strategies to machine-learn refinements of such graph representations (e.g., GCNs or GNNs) by optimizing the task of predicting antibodytarget binding.\nTo set up a multi-task learning framework whereby different prediction tasks are performed jointly (e.g., predicting structural flexibility, binding specificity, binding affinity etc.). Such a framework will rely on graph neural networks and will be designed to obtain single-site predictions of importance to target binding that account for long-range correlations between sites as well as multiple structural and biochemical constraints. These predictions will be key to estimate in silico the effect of mutations and set up a computational framework to guide mutation-based antibody design in the laboratory.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Antibodies are proteins that play a key role in the immune response against pathogens by binding specifically to the pathogen. The body is able to modify sections of antibodies through mutations to improve the specificity and affinity of the binding to unseen pathogens. Consequently, the design of antibodies as possible therapeutic tools that can bind to specific targets (e.g., pathogens, cancerous cells) is an area of highly active research. However, which molecular and structural properties determine the specific binding of antibodies to protein targets remains unclear, thus hampering our understanding of the mutational effects in the immune response and impeding progress in the rational design of antibodies. In this project, we will develop machine learning methods to predict antibodies’ functional properties related to their binding that are informed by biophysical modelling of their sequence and structure as captured by graph-based representations of antibody-protein interactions. In particular, the aim of these models is to predict and characterize single-site mutations that can improve antibody binding to specific targets without compromising other biophysical properties, with potential applications in antibody design.\n\n\nTo achieve our main goal, we will leverage various machine learning approaches which we have developed, and we will develop new ones to exploit the increasing amount of data on antibodies and their cognate target proteins. Schematically, the objectives and tasks of the project will be:\n\nTo train a model that can capture long-range complex dependencies between amino acids at different sites along the antibody/protein amino acid chain, and which, accounting for such dependencies, can provide a single-site measure of amino acid importance to target binding. For this task we will build upon a transformer-like architecture [1].\nTo build biophysically informed models of antibody-protein interactions that can give graph representations of such interactions and antibody/protein structures, summarizing and distilling relevant biochemical and structural information. We will employ different graph construction techniques, from geometric graphs that capture packing to biophysical models of energetic interactions to higher-order models (akin to simplicial complexes) that capture many-body interactions in the structure. We will then explore strategies to machine-learn refinements of such graph representations (e.g., GCNs or GNNs) by optimizing the task of predicting antibodytarget binding.\nTo set up a multi-task learning framework whereby different prediction tasks are performed jointly (e.g., predicting structural flexibility, binding specificity, binding affinity etc.). Such a framework will rely on graph neural networks and will be designed to obtain single-site predictions of importance to target binding that account for long-range correlations between sites as well as multiple structural and biochemical constraints. These predictions will be key to estimate in silico the effect of mutations and set up a computational framework to guide mutation-based antibody design in the laboratory. Ongoing collaborations with the Imperial Department of Chemistry, as well as with the LiverpoolImperial AIChemy UKRI Hub in AI will allow us to establish links to experimental antibody design for validation and further development.\n\n\n\n\nThe field of machine learning approaches to biophysical modelling and design of immune-related proteins like antibodies has witnessed growing activity recently [2].

    "section": "",
    "text": "The supervisory team, together with Dr van ’t Wout, has been developing the open-source Python library OptimUS for solving acoustic wave propagation in an unbounded medium in 3D with piecewise homogeneous domains. OptimUS solves the Helmholtz equation using the boundary element method (BEM). It has been used to simulate biomedical ultrasound clinical scenarios relating to treating cancers of the liver and kidney, as well as osteoid osteoma. OptimUS featured as part of an international software benchmarking exercise for ultrasound transcranial neuromodulation, overseen by the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards. The OptimUS library is being used in biomedical ultrasound research in academic affiliations worldwide as well as a pedagogical tool for undergraduate and postgraduate students. The current BEM formulations in OptimUS assume that domains exhibit fluid-like properties. This gives us accurate prediction of ultrasound propagation in soft tissues (e.g. the liver and kidney). However, hard tissues like bones and many dense cancer tumours demonstrate solid-like (elastic) behaviour. This creates a gap in accurately modelling ultrasound propagation in domains with a mix of soft and hard tissues and underscores the need for BEM formulations that represent the physics more accurately.\nOptimUS leverages the BEMpp kernel developed by Prof Betcke in UCL. Prof Chaillat (from ENSTA, Paris, France) is an expert in modelling wave propagation in elastic domains using BEM. She is the main developer of COFFEE, which is a code for solving elastic BEM in separated domains. The supervisory team and the external partners will offer academic mentorship, educational support and access to the state-of-the-art medical imaging and computational facilities (high-performance computing workstations as well as the UCL Research Computing Platforms Service) required for the successful delivery of this project.\n\n\n\nThis project aims to develop an efficient BEM formulation for solving ultrasound wave propagation in mixed domains of soft and hard tissues (i.e., both fluid and elastic domains). The BEM approach uses Green’s functions, which are inherently complex in elastic problems. Also, the equations become ill-conditioned at high frequencies, substantially deteriorating the performance of the solver. To address these challenges, a novel formulation based on the Helmholtz transform will be introduced, building on the team’s previous works in solving the Helmholtz and Maxwell equations. The new formulation will be implemented in the OptimUS software, validated against analytical solutions for canonical geometries, and tested in simulations of ultrasound wave propagation through the human body using anatomical models derived from medical images (ultrasound/MRI/CT scans). The successful completion of this project will have significant implications for the field of biomedical ultrasound, particularly in treatment planning for procedures like focused ultrasound therapy as well as imaging applications such as shear wave elastography. By improving the accuracy and efficiency of simulations, this work will enhance OptimUS and facilitate its adoption in clinical settings, where it could be used for personalised treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe project involves implementing, testing and optimising the computational performance of the new BEM formulation for solving ultrasound waves in complex viscous and elastic domains. The student will be actively involved in software development using Python and employing best practices in software carpentry including version control with Git and automated testing to ensure code reliability and reproducibility. The outcome of this project will impact the field of biomedical ultrasound, specifically for treatment planning, and facilitate the uptake of OptimUS in clinics."

This also has applications in the emulsions and structures used in batteries, an important new application of ultrasound, to test battery integrity.\n\n\nThis will build upon the Pogo software package, which has been used for simulating ultrasound within NDE (Non-Destructive Evaluation) for over 10 years and is now used throughout the world in industry and academia.\nDr Huthwaite has extensive experience with a variety of approximations for simulating waves in different materials, including ray theory (eikonal equation) and Born approximation-type approaches, as well as developing the FE method on graphics cards. He has been involved in techniques to model complex solid media such as large-grained material, developing models of over 1 billion degrees of freedom. Some multi-scale work has been done in the broader research community, typically with small-scale evaluations to estimate homogenised properties, which are then used for larger simulations. Multi-physics approaches have also been utilised and are common in areas such as transduction where different phenomena need to be coupled, but integrating these with multi-scale techniques presents a new challenge.\n\n\n\nDeliver an efficient approach for accurate modelling of wave propagation through multiscale, multi-physics problems. Apply the method to propagation through complex structures, such as tissue, and ideally compare to experimental measurements.\n\n\n\nThe outcomes will be incorporated into the Pogo software package for application across a variety of areas including NDE, medicine and underwater ultrasound. Describe coding and data developments during the project. Specific techniques will need to be developed to code the method to achieve results without compromising GPU performance."

Numerous software packages exist for performing cell-based simulation of bacterial biofilms and synthetic bacterial communities (e.g. iDynoMiCS, BSim, gro).

Gathering degree documentation, references and other materials is an onerous task for applicants. We will only ask for your academic transcript if you are invited for an interview. Full documentation will only be required when we are ready to make an offer to a candidate, in order to carry out necessary formal documentation checks.\nPrevious university and degree classification will not be included in the initial review of applications We want to avoid educational bias as much as possible. While we ask for your previous highest degree awarding institution and degree classification this is only used to check minimum eligibility and will not be forwarded to the initial online reviewers.\nMuch of your information remains anonymous in the online sifting. Your voluntary EDI information is hidden and will only be used to gather statistical information. In addition, your name, nationality, country of residence, home or international student status, full or part-time application, highest degree awarding institution, and degree classification will be hidden from the online reviewers.\nIt is your statements that matter. The key points in the application form are What has attracted you to the CCMI CDT?, Describe your background in computational and data sciences., Describe a piece of software that you have developed. Explain other skills and experience that you think will contribute to your success on the CCMI CDT. These questions are designed to allow you to shine and to show us your potential and passion for the CDT.\nDon’t obsess about small typos or mistakes. We all know the feeling of submitting an application and worrying about whether we got everything right. We won’t mark you down for small mistakes. We are looking for potential and passion, not perfection.\nThe precise PhD project matters less than you think. We have a wonderful list of potential PhD projects. Have a look at what is there to get a feel of what we offer. But don’t be nervous about project selection now. If you are successful in the interview we will provide lots of information and support to find the right supervisor for your personal interests and skills. You may already have a precise project in mind. That is great and we will give your preference priority in the project selection. Or you may not know yet what you want to do. That is also great and we will help you find the right project for you. Also, never forget, the project that you start with is rarely the precise project that you finish with. Research is unpredictable. You may start with one idea and end up being lead down a very different pathway during your PhD."

    "text": "What is CCMI?\n\n\n\n\n\nCCMI stands for Collaborative Computational Modelling at the Interface. Our vision is to train a future generation of scientists working at the interface of physics driven modelling, data driven modelling and research software engineering. Our trainees will move fluently across these interfaces, understanding their interdependencies to build the next generation of simulations and translate them to impacts in industry and society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a CDT?\n\n\n\n\n\nCDT stands for ‘Centre for Doctoral Training’, where Universities, and their partners, come together to offer combined research and expertise to support and train PhD students. By undertaking your PhD in a CDT, you’ll be part of a prestigious cohort that will study together within a structured programme, providing a supportive and collaborative environment. You’ll join a thriving group and carry out your research alongside people from different backgrounds, with different perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will a PhD from the CCMI CDT benefit my career?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will receive cutting edge training on the interface of data sciences, simulation, and research software engineering, opening up careers across research and engineering, the financial sector, tech companies, and anywhere that data and simulations are relevant. Your software skills will make you a highly sought after candidate for any development role and provide an advantage over many other data or simulation oriented PhD level training programmes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow long is the programme?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe programme is available as a 4 year, full time programme.\nThere is an option to study part time. This is available to postgraduate researchers that do not need a student visa to study in the UK. Please contact us before applying if you are interested in part time study, as schedules will be built on a case by case basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many students will there be in each cohort?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be approximately 14 students per cohort, starting in September each year of admission. These studentships will be evenly distributed across UCL and Imperial.\nThere will be a total of approximately 70-80 students, over a 5 year period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen will the PhD Programme start?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first cohort in the CCMI CDT will start in September 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre these PhD opportunities funded? What is the stipend payment?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, postgraduate researchers at the CCMI CDT will receive a full 4 year studentship (pro-rata for part-time students)\nTo cover living expenses, the UKRI rate (London-weighted) doctoral stipend, plus an additional £2,000 top-up, will be paid to postgraduate researchers each year, in regular instalments. The UKRI stipends tend to increase each year with inflation. The stipend for 2025/2026 will be confirmed in Spring 2025, but is estimated to be £21,870, giving a total estimated stipend of £23,870 including top-up. For more information on UKRI stipends, please visit their website.\nAnnual tuition will be paid and there is funding available to support research training costs such as conference attendance.\nFor additional information on the cost of studying in London, please visit the UCL website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to choose a topic for my PhD research?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, you don’t need to contact a supervisor before applying. Unlike more traditional approaches to applying for a PhD, if you are interested in applying for the CCMI CDT, you are not required or expected to contact anyone about project supervision.\nPlease see the list of projects that are offered. If you pass the interview stage, we will hold an open day for you to learn more about the project areas on offer and we will ask you to submit which projects/research areas you are interested in. You will then have a chance to meet with supervisors to discuss projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the programme structured?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CCMI CDT programme rests on 3 foundations - a 4 year research thesis, collaborative interface working groups and a software journey. For more information about the structure of the programme, please visit our Training Programme pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill I get any industrial experience?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all projects will automatically include industry experience. Some projects, co-sponsored by external industry partners, will have an expected placement at the partner institution as an integral part of the research. Some projects may also require students to work elsewhere as part of their research. This will be determined individually, as per the corresponding research projects and will form a component of the thesis.\nWhilst internships are not a mandatory component of the CDT, we do encourage and support students who are interested in industry experience. We welcome this discussion as part of your project matching, should you pass the interview stage of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the entry requirements to apply?\n\n\n\n\n\nA UK Master’s degree in a relevant discipline with Merit, or a minimum of an upper second-class UK Bachelor’s degree in a relevant discipline, or an overseas qualification of an equivalent standard. Work experience may also be taken into account.\nRelevant disciplines are broadly STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics). Related disciplines at the interface of STEM may be acceptable. During the application stage, we will assess the suitability of your technical background.\nThe English language level for this programme is: Level 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI already have a PhD qualification, can I still apply?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, you can apply for the CCMI CDT if you already have obtained a PhD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat funding rules do I need to be aware of?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are residence requirements for postgraduate research funding from Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). UKRI-funded studentships are open to UK (home) and international students. To be considered a ‘home’ student, you must meet one of the following criteria set out by UKRI:\n\nbe a UK national\nhave settled status\nhave pre-settled status\nhave indefinite leave to remain or enter.\n\nAdditionally, you will need to meet specified residency requirements. The decision about fee status will be taken by the host university before a formal offer is made. If a candidate does not meet any of the above criteria, they will be classified as an international student. International applicants are eligible for tuition fees at the UK rate and a stipend at the UKRI rate. Some scholarships to cover the difference to full overseas tuition rates may be available and are given out on a competitive basis. However, there are restrictions on the number of overseas applicants funded through the CDT.\nWe encourage applications from international candidates, but please be aware that there is typically strong competition within universities for this limited funding.\nNormally, to be eligible for a full award from the EPSRC, a student must a) have no restrictions on how long they can stay in the UK and b) have been ordinarily resident in the UK for at least 3 years prior to the start of the studentship. For more details visit the UKRI website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I apply?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application procedure consists of 4 stages: The Online Application, Interview, Project Matching, and pro-forma application for document and fee status check. Please see full details of our application process at our Application Procedure page. If applications are not yet open, but you would like to be notified when they are, please do register your interest and we will notify you when applications open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to submit a research proposal or choose supervisor when I apply?\n\n\n\n\n\nNo. Before you apply, we would ask you to review the projects on offer at the ‘Projects’ page on our website.\nIf you pass the interview stage of the application process, you will have the opportunity to learn more about our projects and supervisors. You will be asked submit your top three preferred projects so we can understand your research interests. You will then meet potential supervisors one on one during our supervisor matching process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI haven’t yet graduated from my current university course, can I still apply?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. At the initial application stage we will ask you about qualifications you have already achieved, your current studies and predicted grades. If successful at interview and project matching, you would be made an offer which is conditional upon the outcome of your current studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to upload references when I apply?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do not ask for references at the initial application stage. If you reach the offer stage, you will then be asked to supply references. References will be submitted after project matching, directly to UCL or Imperial, with your pro-forma application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen will the interviews take place?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all relevant application deadlines please see the information under How to apply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen will I know if my application has been successful?\n\n\n\n\n\nShould you be invited to interview, we would aim to inform you of the outcome of the interview within a week."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The application procedure consists of the following four steps.\n1.) The online application. We ask you to submit an application to our online submission system. Based on your application we will make a first sift of the candidates and invite shortlisted candidates for interview.\n2.) The Interview. For the interview we will ask you to prepare a short presentation and answer a mixture of questions covering technical background and your motivation to join the CDT. The interview questions will be communicated to applicants beforehand so that they have sufficient time to prepare for the technical and non-technical part.\n3.) The project matching. Once you pass the interview we aim to match you with a supervisor. We will prepare an online info session about the different research areas of the CDT and you have opportunities to ask questions and discuss project choices. Your project will decide wether you will be enrolled at UCL or Imperial College. Every student can submit three preferred project choices. We will circulate your information after the interview stage with the corresponding supervisors and you can also discuss the projects directly with them. If both, you and the supervisor come together for one of your preferred projects you are matched and you proceed to the offer stage. If none of your three preferred projects leads to a match we will suggest another project for you based on your background. Should you accept you will proceed to the offer stage. If no match with a project/supervisor is possible you will not receive an offer.\n4.) The offer stage. You will be asked to submit a pro-forma application to either UCL or Imperial depending on your project match. This is only to make a formal document check about information you have submitted beforehand and to receive a formal offer from your chosen university on successful document check. The offer may be conditional on language test and the outcome of your current degree if you haven’t finished your previous studies at the time of application to the CDT."

    "text": "Within many fusion power plant concepts, breeder blankets fulfil a multi-functional role. Neutrons emitted in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions must be absorbed, in part to reduce damaging irradiation to other essential components (such as superconducting magnets) and outer structural material. The neutrons’ energy must be converted to heat; the heat must be transported by a coolant where it will be ultimately employed to drive conventional steam-based turbines for generation of electricity. Some neutrons must also participate in reactions to breed tritium to sustain fusion reactions. The tritium must be extracted at a rate that supports plant availability. Structural material must remain within safe operational conditions, while significant pressure drops in the coolant must be minimised to optimise power plant efficiency. Materials suitable for each of these functions are usually not interchangeable and thus there are necessarily trade-offs in the spatial allocation for the sub-components responsible for each function. This domain is therefore highly suitable for a multi-objective optimisation over geometric parameters.\nSimulation of the breeder blanket must necessarily span multiple physics domains, minimally including neutronics, heat transfer and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Depending on the level of fidelity selected for CFD - which may range from 1D correlations, reduced order turbulence models, through to direct numerical simulations - the computational cost for evaluating a single design point can vary enormously. A lack of fidelity may conceal emergent phenomenon; such effects have already been noted in reference [1] where local hotspots were observed only with higher fidelity models. Meanwhile too much fidelity may render unviable any optimisation algorithm. We propose a multi-fidelity approach, where inexpensive low-fidelity simulations inform the query to expensive high-fidelity simulations towards the global optimum.\nBesides setting the appropriate level of fidelity, there are other considerations in ensuring robustness to the optimisation procedure. The limited tolerances in the manufacturing process imply an uncertainty in the material composition and inevitable small differences in the component shape compared to the simulated one. Furthermore, the empirical nuclide cross-section data for those materials (which are inputs to the neutron transport calculations) are often associated with significant uncertainties. As such, the optimisation procedure should select configurations that are stable under small perturbations in both parameter space and in the input nuclear data.\nBayesian Optimisation provides a theoretically solid foundation to perform sample-efficient maximisation of a noisy black-box function, with guaranteed convergence rates. In this project, the efficacy of Bayesian optimisation methods applied to breeder blankets will be explored.\n\n\nRecent years have seen the development of scalable and open-source multi-physics software that is suitable for the modelling of fusion components. In particular, the MOOSE framework [2] offers a flexible platform for the solution of arbitrary partial differential equations using the finite element method, with many built-in physics modules as well as couplings to specialist tools for Monte Carlo neutron transport (OpenMC) [3,4] and spectral element computational fluid dynamics (NekRS) [5]. MOOSE applications have been used to simulate a variety of breeder blanket concept designs, including both solid ceramic and liquid lead-lithium breeders [6,7,8].\nParametric optimisation studies involving MOOSE for analysis have already been performed for the simple case of a divertor monoblock component [9]. While such studies are indicative of methodology, a limiting factor in pursuing a similar approach to breeder blankets until recently was the existence of a suitable tool to generate geometry. However, a blanket geometry engine, Hypnos, has recently been developed, with an initial demonstration of the software indicating that geometric optimisation is now possible [10]. With a proven tool-chain already in place for analysis, the primary area for innovation would pertain to the development and deployment of the optimisation algorithms themselves, with a particular focus on the robustness of the outcomes.\nIn decision problems arising from industrial processes, the design parameters are often subject to uncertainty. This uncertainty can stem from limited data observability, noisy measurements, implementation challenges, or prediction errors. In the context of manufacturing, this uncertainty may arise from manufacturing tolerances, and material imperfections. Stochastic Optimsation (SO) methods have classically allowed to model this uncertainty within a decision-making framework, assuming that the decision maker has complete knowledge about the underlying uncertainty through a known probability distribution. On the other hand, in robust optimisation it is assumed that the decision maker has only minimal distributional knowledge about the underlying uncertainty, and the optimiser seeks to minimise the worst-case outcome over an uncertainty set. This has been extended to the multi-objective optimisation case in several works, where one identifies a pareto front of candidate solutions which are favourable against a set of distinct objectives. Motivated by practical limitations due to manufacturing tolerances, in [11] a robust multi-objective optimisation approach known as constraint active search (CAS) is proposed, which aims to identify diverse solutions in the region of the search space that exceeds a minimum threshold on the objectives, leveraging a post-hoc sensitivity analysis process to assess the robustness of candidate points under input noise [12].\nApproaching robust design by decoupling data collection and sensitivity analysis is central to the Taguchi method [13]. Data acquisition often revolves around finding designs that balance the mean and variance of the sensitive objective under input noise. Daulton et al [14] extended the Bayesian optimisation framework to black-box multi-objective optimisation problems, identifying a pareto front of candidate solutions with associated robustness guarantees. Integration of these approaches with large-scale simulation frameworks remains a challenge. In [14] the authors derive a new framework for batch-based black-box optimisation which enables the effective use of parallel simulations to obtain high-quality optimisation candidates. This was subsequently applied in the context of calibrating JOREK, and MHD simulator for fusion in [15]. In [16] the authors explore another optimisation-centric decision problem, namely design of experiments for optimal sensor placement, which is able to exploit multi-resolution simulation data through resolution-invariant learning methods.\n[1] F.

This concept is already well-established; having been considered by EU-DEMO during the preconceptual phase (2014-2020) it is being actively pursued in the conceptual design phase (2021-2027).

    "title": "Robust Multi-objective and Mutli-fidelity Bayesian Optimisation of Fusion Breeder Blankets",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Within many fusion power plant concepts, breeder blankets fulfil a multi-functional role. Neutrons emitted in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions must be absorbed, in part to reduce damaging irradiation to other essential components (such as superconducting magnets) and outer structural material. The neutrons’ energy must be converted to heat; the heat must be transported by a coolant where it will be ultimately employed to drive conventional steam-based turbines for generation of electricity. Some neutrons must also participate in reactions to breed tritium to sustain fusion reactions. The tritium must be extracted at a rate that supports plant availability. Structural material must remain within safe operational conditions, while significant pressure drops in the coolant must be minimised to optimise power plant efficiency. Materials suitable for each of these functions are usually not interchangeable and thus there are necessarily trade-offs in the spatial allocation for the sub-components responsible for each function. This domain is therefore highly suitable for a multi-objective optimisation over geometric parameters.\nSimulation of the breeder blanket must necessarily span multiple physics domains, minimally including neutronics, heat transfer and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Depending on the level of fidelity selected for CFD - which may range from 1D correlations, reduced order turbulence models, through to direct numerical simulations - the computational cost for evaluating a single design point can vary enormously. A lack of fidelity may conceal emergent phenomenon; such effects have already been noted in reference [1] where local hotspots were observed only with higher fidelity models. Meanwhile too much fidelity may render unviable any optimisation algorithm. We propose a multi-fidelity approach, where inexpensive low-fidelity simulations inform the query to expensive high-fidelity simulations towards the global optimum.\nBesides setting the appropriate level of fidelity, there are other considerations in ensuring robustness to the optimisation procedure. The limited tolerances in the manufacturing process imply an uncertainty in the material composition and inevitable small differences in the component shape compared to the simulated one. Furthermore, the empirical nuclide cross-section data for those materials (which are inputs to the neutron transport calculations) are often associated with significant uncertainties. As such, the optimisation procedure should select configurations that are stable under small perturbations in both parameter space and in the input nuclear data.\nBayesian Optimisation provides a theoretically solid foundation to perform sample-efficient maximisation of a noisy black-box function, with guaranteed convergence rates. In this project, the efficacy of Bayesian optimisation methods applied to breeder blankets will be explored.\n\n\nRecent years have seen the development of scalable and open-source multi-physics software that is suitable for the modelling of fusion components. In particular, the MOOSE framework [2] offers a flexible platform for the solution of arbitrary partial differential equations using the finite element method, with many built-in physics modules as well as couplings to specialist tools for Monte Carlo neutron transport (OpenMC) [3,4] and spectral element computational fluid dynamics (NekRS) [5]. MOOSE applications have been used to simulate a variety of breeder blanket concept designs, including both solid ceramic and liquid lead-lithium breeders [6,7,8].\nParametric optimisation studies involving MOOSE for analysis have already been performed for the simple case of a divertor monoblock component [9]. While such studies are indicative of methodology, a limiting factor in pursuing a similar approach to breeder blankets until recently was the existence of a suitable tool to generate geometry. However, a blanket geometry engine, Hypnos, has recently been developed, with an initial demonstration of the software indicating that geometric optimisation is now possible [10]. With a proven tool-chain already in place for analysis, the primary area for innovation would pertain to the development and deployment of the optimisation algorithms themselves, with a particular focus on the robustness of the outcomes.\nIn decision problems arising from industrial processes, the design parameters are often subject to uncertainty. This uncertainty can stem from limited data observability, noisy measurements, implementation challenges, or prediction errors. In the context of manufacturing, this uncertainty may arise from manufacturing tolerances, and material imperfections. Stochastic Optimsation (SO) methods have classically allowed to model this uncertainty within a decision-making framework, assuming that the decision maker has complete knowledge about the underlying uncertainty through a known probability distribution. On the other hand, in robust optimisation it is assumed that the decision maker has only minimal distributional knowledge about the underlying uncertainty, and the optimiser seeks to minimise the worst-case outcome over an uncertainty set. This has been extended to the multi-objective optimisation case in several works, where one identifies a pareto front of candidate solutions which are favourable against a set of distinct objectives. Motivated by practical limitations due to manufacturing tolerances, in [11] a robust multi-objective optimisation approach known as constraint active search (CAS) is proposed, which aims to identify diverse solutions in the region of the search space that exceeds a minimum threshold on the objectives, leveraging a post-hoc sensitivity analysis process to assess the robustness of candidate points under input noise [12].\nApproaching robust design by decoupling data collection and sensitivity analysis is central to the Taguchi method [13]. Data acquisition often revolves around finding designs that balance the mean and variance of the sensitive objective under input noise. Daulton et al [14] extended the Bayesian optimisation framework to black-box multi-objective optimisation problems, identifying a pareto front of candidate solutions with associated robustness guarantees. Integration of these approaches with large-scale simulation frameworks remains a challenge. In [14] the authors derive a new framework for batch-based black-box optimisation which enables the effective use of parallel simulations to obtain high-quality optimisation candidates. This was subsequently applied in the context of calibrating JOREK, and MHD simulator for fusion in [15]. In [16] the authors explore another optimisation-centric decision problem, namely design of experiments for optimal sensor placement, which is able to exploit multi-resolution simulation data through resolution-invariant learning methods.\n[1] F.

    "text": "Pseudospectral time domain models of wave propagation, in which wave equations are solved using spectral methods for computing spatial gradients and corrected-finite-difference schemes for the temporal integration, are increasingly widely used in acoustics, eg. in therapeutic and diagnostic biomedical ultrasound (imaging and therapy), and in large-scale underwater acoustics. This has been driven largely by the success of our software k-Wave, a toolbox for modelling linear and nonlinear wave propagation, written initially in Matlab but with alternative implementations now available. There are currently &gt;16,000 registered k-Wave users from &gt;70 countries who have downloaded at least one version of k-Wave, with &gt;4000 users downloading the latest release (a proxy for active users). This makes k-Wave one of the most widely used open-source tools in acoustics. The two main journal articles describing k-Wave have been cited over 2500 times. Recently, we began working on a new version of the software, k-Wave 2.0, which involves re-engineering the code base to leverage object orientated programming and differentiable functions to facilitate its use in deep learning and coupled physics problems. In addition, we are taking the opportunity to extend the algorithms underlying k-Wave so that the inputs (sources, sensors, medium properties, boundary conditions) can be defined arbitrarily in space and are not dependent on the underlying grid used for the computations. Our vision is for k-Wave 2.0 to be largely grid-independent, as far as the user is concerned. (This is guided in part by the philosophy that drives k-Wave development, that of lowering the barrier to entry for potential users as much as possible.) In the current version of k-Wave it is already possible to use ‘off-grid’ sources and sensors. This has been achieved by exploiting the fact that the bandlimited interpolant implicit in the numerical scheme is known to a high degree of accuracy [REF]. Furthermore, we have shown that reflecting boundary conditions can, in a restricted set of cases, be implemented by exploiting the symmetries in discrete sine and cosine transforms to automatically compute image source, but this approach is limited to planar boundaries and short duration simulations.\n\n\n\nThe two main limitations of k-Wave are (1) the staircasing effect that heterogeneous medium properties are subject to, because they have to be defined at the grid points and are undefined in-between, and (2) the fact that only boundary condition currently implemented is an absorbing boundary condition (perfectly matched layer) mimicking free-space propagation. The objectives of this project are to develop and code numerical schemes that overcome these limitations.\nFirst, we propose to tackle the problem of defining the medium properties independently of the grid by rearranging the governing equations so that terms containing heterogeneous medium properties are reformulated as equivalent scattering terms, and exploiting and extending the off-grid approach currently used to implement sources and sensors. A preliminary simulation with a toy model and a sound speed heterogeneity gives us confidence this approach will work, but its extension to other heterogeneities, eg. density, absorption, nonlinearity parameter has not been explored.\nSecond, we aim to implement arbitrary boundary conditions by computing, at each time-step, the distributed image source that would be required to mimic the effect of the boundary. This strategy, which will also employ the off-grid machinery, extends the conventional idea of an image source in a planar reflector to that of an arbitrarily-shaped boundary. Preliminary work has demonstrated this idea in the simple scenario of a perfectly-reflecting circular boundary, but the extent to which it can be extended to impedance boundaries with arbitrary geometries remains to be seen.\nFor both these areas of research, as well as the question of what the optimal algorithms and numerical schemes are, there remain questions as to how they are best implemented in k-Wave 2.0, both from the perspective of computational efficiency as well as the user experience.\n\n\n\nThe algorithms and code developed as part of the project will be directly contributing to k-Wave 2.0. k-Wave 2.0 is being developed within a GitHub repository with the help of UCL’s Advanced Research Computing group, and following a rigorous software development protocol."

They allow the fast approximate evaluation of interactions of N particles with each other in linear complexity instead of quadratic complexity when naive direct evaluation methods are being used. The FMM goes back to Rokhlin and Greengard in 1987 and has since undergone substantial algorithmic and computational advances. FMM on GPUs for example won the Gordon Bell Price in 2009. However, while advances continued over the last ten years little work has been done to exploit Fast Multipole Methods beyond classical GPU computing. In particular, modern designs such as unified memory architectures on Apple Silicone and Nvidia Grace Hopper, mixed precision computations, or the use of tensor units in modern accelerators have received little attention.\nWe have started building up in our group our own FMM expertise as part of the Bempp project. Using Rust as main driver language we have developed a CPU based FMM that is highly portable and competitive with other established Fast Multipole libraries. We are currently porting this effort over to MPI based clusters. Most of this work has been part of the PhD thesis of an existing student in Betcke’s group.\n\n\nBased on our existing experience with our CPU based FMM implementation we want to expand to modern compute architectures. In particular, we have the following objects:\n\nDevelop optimised FMM implementations for unified memory architectures. Within the FMM the key drivers of computational cost are the Particle To Particle Interactions (P2P) and the Multipole 2 Locale Interactions (M2L). For a shallow computation tree P2P will dominate. For a deeper tree M2L will dominate. P2P especially benefits from computation on GPU cores. M2L operations can be accelerated on GPUs but often have lower compute intensity than P2P. If CPU and GPU share a unified address space and fast overall memory accesses many of the implementational problems of full GPU based FMM fall away and we can flexibly decide between work on CPU and on GPU cores. We want to exploit this to optimise new FMM implementations that make full use of unified memory architectures.\nExploit mixed precision arithmetic computations. For many applications it is enough for an FMM to deliver 6 to 7 digits of accuracy, which is just about in the limit of FP32 computations. However, naive implementation on FP32 often leads to fewer correct digits. We want to investigate which operations to run on FP64, and which to accelerate via FP32 while still being able to maintain sufficiently high accuracy for the FMM.\nOptimise for matrix-multiplication operations.. Many modern FMM formulation can be written in terms of matrix-matrix products, which can make use of tensor cores and other specialised registers for AI computations. We want to investigate how these can be used as part of the FMM workflow and allow speed-up of the overall computation.\n\n\n\n\nThe student will take time to familiarise themselves with our existing Rust code base, interface C++ to access accelerator devices and develop FMM on unified architectures. We therefore think the first part of FMM on unified architectures will take roughly two years of project time. In parallel the student will slowly get started on mixed precision experiments, and we expect this part of the project to be around one year in length, once the student has already assembled more experience on developing FMM. The final part on tensor and other AI accelerators will then build on the codebase and research experience with mixed precision arithmetic that the student has built up and will mainly take part in the last 1-1.5 years of the PhD.\n\n\n\nWe are currently preparing for release our first Rust based FMM version.

So much of this work will be in C++ and interfaced to the Rust driver codes for the FMM. A particular interest is also to use Apple Silicone as unified memory environment for FMM. While not being used directly in HPC, Apple Silicon is widely spread and a cost effective way to develop unified memory codes. For HPC we will target Nvidia’s Grace Hopper, meaning the student will need to write separate low-level kernel implementations for Apple Metal and Nvidia Cuda.

    "title": "Efficient Computation of Transition States in Molecular Dynamics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Transition states govern the outcomes of molecular reactions. Therefore, determining the transition states of molecules is a fundamental challenge encountered across diverse fields, including chemical physics, biology, material science, and chemical engineering. However, current numerical methods fall short of what is needed in practice because transition states are rare events within a high-dimensional stochastic dynamical system. As a result, the simulation of rare events is generally intractable and requires domain-specific knowledge of the underlying molecular system or extensive and time consuming trial-and-error computations.\n\n\n\nThe theoretical foundations of our methodology are provided by the remarkable fact that, under appropriate technical conditions, the eigenforms of a particular type of operator, known as the Witten Laplacian, concentrate on transition states. However, there is a catch: solving the associated Witten PDE in high dimensions is currently impractical. The objective of this project is to take of advantage of recent developments that showed how to represent the Witten PDE as a system of stochastic differential equations.[1] This opens the door to new numerical methods utilizing state-of-the-art stochastic simulation and machine learning methods. These advancements are especially promising for harnessing the power of massively parallel computing.\nThere is a deep connection between the stochastic dynamics in used to understand saddle points and gradient flows. Associated with the stochastic representation in [1] there is a partial differential equation, the Fokker-Planck equation, that describes the evolution of the probability density of the stochastic dynamics. In a seminal paper, the authors in [2] made a connection between gradient flows and the Fokker-Planck equation. Moreover, their proof is constructive and based on an implicit discretization scheme that is known as the JKO scheme. Recent works have shown how to leverage the connection between the Fokker-Planck equation and gradient flows to develop numerical methods to solve for the probability density function of the stochastic representation directly. Unfortunately, the implementation of the JKO scheme requires the solution of a large optimization problem at each iteration. To address this challenge, you will study advanced distributed optimization methods that can scale to large dimensions. A more speculative direction of research is to explore whether the Witten PDE can also be written as a gradient flow in an appropriate space. If successful, this direction will lead to a new class of algorithms for computing transition states.\n[1] T. Lelièvre, P. Parpas.

    "title": "Efficient Computation of Transition States in Molecular Dynamics",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Transition states govern the outcomes of molecular reactions. Therefore, determining the transition states of molecules is a fundamental challenge encountered across diverse fields, including chemical physics, biology, material science, and chemical engineering. However, current numerical methods fall short of what is needed in practice because transition states are rare events within a high-dimensional stochastic dynamical system. As a result, the simulation of rare events is generally intractable and requires domain-specific knowledge of the underlying molecular system or extensive and time consuming trial-and-error computations.\n\n\n\nThe theoretical foundations of our methodology are provided by the remarkable fact that, under appropriate technical conditions, the eigenforms of a particular type of operator, known as the Witten Laplacian, concentrate on transition states. However, there is a catch: solving the associated Witten PDE in high dimensions is currently impractical. The objective of this project is to take of advantage of recent developments that showed how to represent the Witten PDE as a system of stochastic differential equations.[1] This opens the door to new numerical methods utilizing state-of-the-art stochastic simulation and machine learning methods. These advancements are especially promising for harnessing the power of massively parallel computing.\nThere is a deep connection between the stochastic dynamics in used to understand saddle points and gradient flows. Associated with the stochastic representation in [1] there is a partial differential equation, the Fokker-Planck equation, that describes the evolution of the probability density of the stochastic dynamics. In a seminal paper, the authors in [2] made a connection between gradient flows and the Fokker-Planck equation. Moreover, their proof is constructive and based on an implicit discretization scheme that is known as the JKO scheme. Recent works have shown how to leverage the connection between the Fokker-Planck equation and gradient flows to develop numerical methods to solve for the probability density function of the stochastic representation directly. Unfortunately, the implementation of the JKO scheme requires the solution of a large optimization problem at each iteration. To address this challenge, you will study advanced distributed optimization methods that can scale to large dimensions. A more speculative direction of research is to explore whether the Witten PDE can also be written as a gradient flow in an appropriate space. If successful, this direction will lead to a new class of algorithms for computing transition states.\n[1] T. Lelièvre, P. Parpas.

    "text": "In inverse problems (IPs) a natural role for deep learning (DL) is to encode prior information contained in the training set e.g. anatomical and pathological similarities between patients. Learned reconstruction methods realise this in different ways learning a prior/proximal operator for use within an optimisation scheme or a post-processing correction or a pseudo-inverse e.g. via an unrolled scheme (see [1] for an overview of such methods, [2] for methods with convergence guarantees, [3, 4] for examples our group’s work in the context of Photoacoustic tomography). While general PDE solvers are designed to work for all coefficients (in an appropriate function space), for the PDEs modelling the forward operator of a nonlinear IP we may have additional information about the distribution of the coefficients which can be used to improve performance. This idea underpins approaches based on unrolling of an iterative forward solver e.g., specifically in the context of solution of high frequency Helmholtz equation, GMRES with the net acting as a (flexible) parametric preconditioner [5], or iterates of a learned Born series [6], and more generic neural operators which directly construct a neural network approximation to the Green’s function of a linear PDE as a function of its coefficients (see e.g. [7,8,9]).\n\n\n\nThis project will combine both these strands of research. We will seek to optimise the forward solver’s performance for the coefficients on the manifold of the prior which is akin to adaptivity in classical PDE solvers and combine it optimally with the leaned prior into an all-at-once inversion procedure. Possible approaches to construction of such an all-at-once framework include: Unrolling and parametrisation of a nonlinear solver, e.g. Gauss-Newton, for minimising a regularised nonlinear data fitting functional. The Fréchet derivative of the nonlinear data term involves solution of the forward PDE and its adjoint which can be replaced by neural operators (or forward unrolling). The regularisation functional can be replaced with an input convex neural network, or for non-smooth priors, the prox of the regularisation functional can be replaced with a neural network. The whole assembly can then be jointly trained on the same training set following one of the training paradigms e.g. variational, fix point or adversarial. Another formulation can be proposed based on a PDE constraint optimisation framework which opts to minimise the regularised linear data consistency term subject to PDE constraints. The first order optimality conditions contain the Fréchet derivative, the forward and adjoint PDE solves, and the derivative of the regularisation functional, which again can be parametrised similarly as described above and used e.g. as a direction within first order optimisation method.

    "title": "Developing Quasi-Geostrophic Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Model",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This Project would be ideal for a student who seeks to develop skills in software engineering for computational modelling, scientific computing, data science, geophysical fluid dynamics, and climate science research. It aims for a major overhaul and upgrade of the existing Quasi-Geostrophic Coupled Model (Q-GCM) of the ocean-atmosphere system to convert this model into a versatile modular community code for extremely fast high-resolution climate modelling in arbitrary geometrical setups. The model’s ability to quickly produce global-scope multi-century climate simulations faithfully representing mesoscale ocean–atmosphere interactions would allow it to set the milestones for future research of fundamental climate processes that are currently out of reach for state-of-the-art coupled General Circulation Models (GCMs) due to prohibitive computational expenses of such simulations.\nAdvancing our understanding of multi-scale climate variability is at the heart of the Project. A particular focus here is on the internal variability of the ocean-atmosphere subsystem of the climate system, which can occur even in the absence of variations in the external forcing. Such variability can generally be classified to fall into one of the following categories:\n\ninternal variability of the oceans;\ninternal variability of the atmosphere; and\ncoupled ocean–atmosphere variability.\n\nOf course, other factors contribute to the climate variability modes on different levels (e.g., interaction with cryosphere, coupled land–atmosphere processes, and so forth). Most coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs do not yet adequately discriminate between the scenarios (i)–(iii), because the model dynamics still lacks accurate representation of small-scale processes due to their insufficient horizontal resolutions. In particular, global coupled GCMs do not have the required capability to resolve routinely the oceanic weather represented by multi-scale ensembles of synoptic mesoscale eddies, which evolve in a complicated, spatially inhomogeneous and poorly understood way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Left panel: Snapshot with results of FESOM1.4 (Wang et al. 2014) simulation on the global mesh with 4 km resolution in the full North Atlantic; white color shows upper-ocean flow speed; note the intense Gulf stream current with surrounding turbulence. Right panel: Snapshot of the upper-ocean potential vorticity anomaly as simulated by the idealized square-box quasigeostrophic ocean model coupled to the atmosphere; this model produces turbulent Gulf stream that couples to the underlying atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThe cutting edge high-resolution ocean modelling efforts, which involve enormous computational expenses https://fesom.de/models/fesom14/ typically produce a single realization worth of a few decades of simulation at most, with marginally accepted dynamical resolution of the eddies achieved at least for midlatitudes (note that at high latitudes the eddies and, hence, required resolutions become even smaller). Many such simulations are also run in the ocean-only context, despite the growing evidence that the mesoscale air-sea interaction affects, in major — and, perhaps, nonlinear ways, — the atmospheric large-scale low-frequency variability (Mathews et al. 2024). However, climate-type simulations not only require hundreds of multi-century runs for robust statistical ensemble predictions, but they also have to consider different environmental scenarios (e.g., for greenhouse gas emissions) and sensitivities to many physical factors. The ability to faithfully characterize the effects of the mesoscale ocean eddies and currents in a coupled, global setting is a major stumbling block in climate research, and is thus one of the grand research challenges of our time.\nOne way out of this deadlock is to develop accurate statistical–dynamical eddy parameterizations for the use in realistic models, which is a major task of its own. An alternative way, proposed here, is to make use of intermediate-complexity coupled ocean–atmosphere process models capable of accessing new and crucial knowledge about the processes involved, yet casting them in advanced settings that would permit direct comparisons with the real world’s climate variability.\nIndeed, driven by the surging demand of climate science, the last two decades witnessed development of idealized, intermediate-complexity, midlatitude, quasi-geostrophic (QG), ocean–atmosphere coupled models, which can routinely resolve oceanic mesoscale eddies (Hogg et al. 2003; Kravtsov et al. 2007; Berloff et al. 2007a). These models are at least 100 times more computationally efficient than the heavy-duty global coupled GCMs. The Q-GCM of Hogg et al. (2003), which is a starting point of this project, couples its oceanic and atmospheric subsystems via ageostrophic boundary layers of both fluids. Aside from the natural limitation of QG models to be formally accurate within the midlatitude belts, these models are cast in the simplest square-basin or channel geometries, which hinders their immediate application to interpreting the observed climate variability. Yet, Q-GCM is a powerful tool for simulating midlatitude coupled climate variability with fully resolved oceanic mesoscale turbulence.\nIdealized eddy-resolving ocean and coupled modelling thus far established not only existence and robustness of the intrinsic ocean-only variability dubbed as the rbulent Oscillator (e.g., Berloff et al. 2007b), but also the importance of this variability for the ocean-atmosphere coupled variability (Kravtsov et al. 2007; Kurashina and Berloff 2023a,b). Similar fundamental importance of the eddies for driving decadal variability has been established in the Southern Ocean (Hogg and Blundell 2006). Considering these coupled dynamics in progressively more realistic Q-GCM is of high priority, but this effort requires significant upgrades of the existing modelling capabilities.\n\n\nThe software development objective of the Project is very significant upgrade of the existing Q-GCM, including generation of modular geometrical setups, addition of new physics and incorporation of superior numerical algorithms, as well as the requisite updates to the post-processing tools and software library. The computational objective of the Project is to produce new multi-century simulations in the northern-hemisphere (NH) and southern-hemisphere (SH) model configurations. More specifically, we hypothesize that in the NH case the Atlantic and Pacific oceans will generate their own internal, large-scale decadal-to-interdecadal Turbulent Oscillator variability, which will be coupled through atmospheric teleconnections. In the SH case the situation is likely to be more complicated, as the midlatitude basins will be also connected via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The analysis objective of the Project is to gain dynamical understanding of the involved variabilities.\n\n\n\nThe starting point for the Project will be the most recent study of the Q-GCM idealized-ocean double-gyre coupling with the atmosphere, in which new, zonally asymmetric coupled variability modes have been discovered and understood (Kurashina and Berloff 2023a,b). The following Q-GCM model developments are envisioned:\n\nAdding the second (rectangular) ocean basin to represent Atlantic-Pacific teleconnections (NB: this configuration can be passed to a Master student for spin-off project);\nAdding capabilities for representing (arbitrary and) realistically shaped basins (this requires complete overhaul of the elliptic solver with the matrix capacitance method, and recoding the boundary conditions);\nUpgrading advection operators in both ocean and atmosphere components with the high-resolution, efficient CABARET advection scheme (Karabasov et al. 2009);\nAdding moist dynamics to the atmosphere (Kravtsov et al. 2022);\nDeveloping realistic NH and SH Q-GCM model configurations (i.e., with two isolated ocean basins; with three ocean basins connected by the circular Southern ocean) and obtaining the corresponding milestone solutions both with high- and low-resolution configurations (the latter will help to quantify effects of the small scales and serve as the basis for eddy parameterizations);\nDeveloping comprehensive post-processing library of numerical routines for both Eulerian and Lagrangian analyses and visualizations of the Q-GCM solutions;\nProviding initial analyses of the milestone solutions; disentangling causalities of the ocean-atmosphere and ocean-ocean couplings, as well as understanding the main mesoscale eddy effects and their mechanisms;\nDeveloping mixed-layer model for dynamics of floating tracers, such as plankton and pollutants; this will in effect prepare ground for the coupled ocean-atmosphere modelling with oceanic biochemistry and with global carbon cycle.\n\nThe student will benefit from the interdisciplinary nature of the Project that combines a great deal of original and creative research within the remit of software engineering for computational modelling, scientific computing, data science, geophysical fluid dynamics, and climate science. Close interactions with external research partners will be a vital aspect of the Project, ensuring its optimal development and success: Prof. Sergey Kravtsov (University of Wisconsin, USA), Prof. William Dewar (Florida State University, USA) and Prof. Andrew Hogg (Australian National University, Australia).

It has been used to simulate biomedical ultrasound clinical scenarios relating to treating cancers of the liver and kidney [2] as well as osteoid osteoma [3]. OptimUS featured as part of an international software benchmarking exercise [4] for ultrasound transcranial neuromodulation, overseen by the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards.

A promising kernel-independent Fast Multipole Method (FMM) BEM has recently been developed for the next release of the Bempp library and has been used to solve the Laplace equation. Research into dedicated high-frequency FMM implementation is needed to achieve BEM simulations on a larger scale than other numerical approaches.

These include, inter alia, Frontier (currently the world’s only exascale computer), Summit, Aurora, LUMI, and Archer2. It is designed to model and simulate personalised blood flow throughout the entire human vasculature, from head to toe. A great deal of software engineering has been invested in getting the code to this performance level, which is almost unrivalled on a global basis. It may well feature as a science driver for the post-exascale world and to ensure that is the case we must continue to support and develop the code base. HemeLB has been developed over more than 15 years within Prof Peter Coveney’s group at the Centre for Computational Science. Its applications are wide-ranging, from smaller scale investigations of blood flow in aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations through to the latest simulations in which HemeLB is coupled to a state of the art model of the human heart (Alya from Barcelona Supercomputing Center).

These applications will evolve in terms of optimising and enhancing the resolution of the simulations, rendering and visualising the output in situ on GPUs and providing a computational steering facility which can be used by both scientists and clinicians when running the code, so as to most effectively assess numerous “what if?” scenarios. The overall field of computational biomedicine is currently evolving fast in the direction of human digital twins (HDTs) and we expect the HemeLB software to be integral to these endeavours within research and clinical applications in the near future too.

In contrast to ensemble Kalman Filters (EnKFs) which are the particle-based algorithms typically used in Data Assimilation and are based on Gaussian approximations, PFs make use of the correct model and can recover strong non-linearities characterising dynamical systems, especially at high resolutions [7]. However, standard PF algorithms are known to suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality.\nRecent research has focused on the development of a new generation of PFs that can be effective for Data Assimilation applications in high dimensions. Such PFs are termed “Localised Particle Filters” (LPFs). LPFs can overcome the curse-of-dimensionality by replacing a single high-dimensional global importance sampling step – across the whole domain of the signal and for all set of arriving observations – with a number of ‘local’ importance sampling steps (at a lower dimension) that only make use of the subset of data that are informative for chosen subdomains. The localised approach is based on the simple remark that observations obtained at a given position of the domain of the signal contain minimal information for parts of the domain which are far from such a position.\nSuch methodological advances have led to LPFs very recently been tested in operational settings in Numerical Weather Forecasting (NWF) [8], where states can be of dimension of O(10^9) or higher."

Algorithmic tools already shown to greatly improve performance of SMC involve e.g.: tempering accompanied by jittering of particles to better disperse the latter across space; adaptation techniques; data-driven improved proposals for particles.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Diffusion processes specified by systems of stochastic differential equations are used to model phenomena in a wide range of settings. Inferring the posterior distribution on the unknown parameters of such models given, potentially partial and noisy, observations of the process is often a computationally demanding task, with even forward simulation of the model typically intractable, necessitating use of numerical integration schemes.

    "text": "The problem of computing quantities of interest taking the form of intractable expectations is widespread in computational statistics, machine learning, and more broadly in the computational sciences. In practice we often need to tackle several integrals which are similar; e.g. related through time or space. However, the vast majority of existing research focuses on refining approximations of a single integral and completely ignores the fact that these are part of a set of related integrals. This key piece of information, if used appropriately, could allow algorithms to share computation across integration tasks, leading to much more accurate estimates. Although a small number of such methods have been proposed, their use is currently very limited due to their high computational cost and the lack of widely available software.\n\n\n\nThe objectives of this project are two-fold: 1) Developing novel algorithms for the transfer of information across integration tasks. Most existing algorithms have a cost which increases cubically with the number of tasks and/or with the number of samples per task. This means that they are not worthwhile in all but the most challenging integration tasks. In this project, the student will explore approximation methods to reduce this from cubic to linear cost. This work will build on the literatures on Monte Carlo methods, kernel methods and Gaussian processes. 2) Developing software for the widespread use of transfer learning for numerical integration. The ProbNum package in Python already includes a basic algorithm to do this, but there is very little support in terms of hyper parameter optimisation and/or advice for practitioners on how to use the methods. Many other methods are also missing. The second objective of this project will therefore be the development of this package and implementation of any novel algorithms developed in the first part of the project. The broader aim will be to make these algorithms broadly available to allow users beyond statistics/machine learning to make use of these methods.\n\n\n\nThe PhD student will contribute to the development of the “ProbNum” python package; see https://probnum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Specifically, they will focus on the implementation of existing, and novel, methods for numerical integration, with a specific focus on methods based on transfer learning. This will be done in collaboration with colleagues and other PhD students at the University of Tuebingen, which are the leads for this package."

However, the vast majority of existing research focuses on refining approximations of a single integral and completely ignores the fact that these are part of a set of related integrals. This key piece of information, if used appropriately, could allow algorithms to share computation across integration tasks, leading to much more accurate estimates. Although a small number of such methods have been proposed, their use is currently very limited due to their high computational cost and the lack of widely available software.\n\n\n\nThe objectives of this project are two-fold: 1) Developing novel algorithms for the transfer of information across integration tasks. Most existing algorithms have a cost which increases cubically with the number of tasks and/or with the number of samples per task. This means that they are not worthwhile in all but the most challenging integration tasks. In this project, the student will explore approximation methods to reduce this from cubic to linear cost. This work will build on the literatures on Monte Carlo methods, kernel methods and Gaussian processes. 2) Developing software for the widespread use of transfer learning for numerical integration. The ProbNum package in Python already includes a basic algorithm to do this, but there is very little support in terms of hyper parameter optimisation and/or advice for practitioners on how to use the methods. Many other methods are also missing. The second objective of this project will therefore be the development of this package and implementation of any novel algorithms developed in the first part of the project. The broader aim will be to make these algorithms broadly available to allow users beyond statistics/machine learning to make use of these methods.\n\n\n\nThe PhD student will contribute to the development of the “ProbNum” python package; see https://probnum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Specifically, they will focus on the implementation of existing, and novel, methods for numerical integration, with a specific focus on methods based on transfer learning. This will be done in collaboration with colleagues and other PhD students at the University of Tuebingen, which are the leads for this package."

The approach is to first use machine learning techniques to find a finite dimensional manifold characterising the dataset. Then we can apply recent stability results for inverse problems with solution in a finite dimensional space, and design finite element methods for which we prove rigorous error estimates up to perturbations of the data and the accuracy of the approximate manifold. Finally, we train neural networks to map from the manifold into the finite element solution space to obtain a reduced order model that can be used for the efficient iterative solution of the inverse problem.

    "text": "Graphs have become a useful tool for representing information in many application domains. Social, computer, sensor and transport networks; molecular structures and business processes – all can be represented as attributed graphs. One of the characteristics of such graphs is dynamism – the graph structure, as well as the attributes of nodes and edges can change over time. The accuracy of predictive and inference models built over dynamic graphs depends on the ability of the models to adapt to these changes. This project will propose novel methods for detecting changes in graphs over time (also known as drifts) and demonstrate their usefulness in downstream machine learning and process mining tasks performed over dynamic graphs. The work will build upon the methods recently proposed by the principal supervisor based on graphs and deep learning for process mining https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025999 and drift detection in business processes https://doi.org/10.3390/e24070910. The PhD student will take this previous work as a basis to both advance the theoretical approach to drift detection in graph streams and demonstrate its generalizability by applying to a new domain, namely, discovering disease trajectories. Disease trajectories represented as graphs can help predict disease progression, risk of developing comorbid disorders and patient outcomes more accurately Kusuma et al. Existing solutions for discovering disease trajectories are based on statistical analysis https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5022 and knowledge graphs https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-020-00228-8, thus computationally expensive and not scalable. Furthermore, these solutions are not capable of adapting to changes over time (e.g. changes in disease progression due to events such as the coronavirus pandemic or introducing a new drug/vaccination). Finally, there is currently no solution exists based on the UK population data. The methods built in this project will be applied to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data, thus revealing the healthcare picture of the entire UK population.\n\n\n\n\nDevelop novel methods for drift detection in graph streams to outperform the state-of-the-art methods according to at least one metric: accuracy, scalability, computational time.\nDemonstrate the generalizability of the developed methods by applying them to several domains such as detecting drifts in business processes and disease trajectories, aiming to outperform the state-of-the-art methods in respective areas according to at least one metric: accuracy, scalability, computational time.\nDevelop software allowing non-domain experts query process graphs to answer a range of research/business questions.\n\n\n\n\nThis project will deliver a disease trajectory browser, similar to the one proposed in https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-18682-4 but based on more advanced process discovery and drift detection in graph streams methods developed as part of this project and leveraging UK population data. The proposed process discovery and drift detection methods will be developed in Python. The discovered graphs will be sorted in a graph database such as Neo4j.
