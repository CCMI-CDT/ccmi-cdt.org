The four year **research thesis** will lead to a PhD degree from either UCL or Imperial College. 

As part of the interview process students choose an available research project either at UCL or at Imperial College.

Thesis topics are across the interface of computational modelling,
data sciences, and research software engineering. While most of our students have supervisors from mathematics, statics, or computer science, we also have some projects in other departments (e.g. chemistry, medicine), as long as they fall into the remit of the CDT.
