title: "Collaborative interface working groups (CIWGs)"
---

Collaborative interface working groups (CIWGs) deliver the core topical training programme that every CCCMI student goes through. 

They are organised in the form of week long cohort workships that cover an introduction to research topics, research and software landscape overviews, exploration of current research challenges, and a discovery phase for future trends and new directions.

In contrast to traditional lectures these working groups are centered around learning *how to be an effective researcher* and will contain significant student led components.

CIWGs are delivered across the first two years in the following topic areas:

- Modern programming models for scientific computing
- Software engineering fundamentals
- Data intensive computations
- PDE Discretisations
- Deep learning in theory and practice
- Responsible computational modelling
- High dimensional problems and optimisation
