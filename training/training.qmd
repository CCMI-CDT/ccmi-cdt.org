The CCMI graduate training programme rests on three foundations.

- [A four year research thesis](thesis.qmd) on the interface of computational sciences, research software engineering, and data sciences.
- [Collaborative interface working groups](working_groups.qmd), which are week long block events that combine topical overviews, research discussions, software exploration, and discovery of new ideas.
- [A software journey](software_journey.qmd) that involves active collaboration in open-source projects, close collaboration with external partners, regular software weeks, sprint sessions, industry talks on software engineering, and many other activities.
