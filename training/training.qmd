The CCMI graduate training programme rests on three foundations.

- [A four year research thesis](thesis.qmd) on the interface of computational sciences, research software engineering, and data sciences.
- Collaborative interface working groups, which are week long block events that combine topical overviews, research discussions, software exploration, and discovery of new ideas.
- A software journey that involves active collaboration in open-source projects, close collaboration with external partners, regular software weeks, sprint sessions, industry talks on software engineering, and many other activities.



he **software journey** has been designed to give every CDT student training to become a world class research software engineer. Students will collaborate on a
diverse range of open-source software projects, some suggested by students themselves, others by academics or industrial partners. Students will learn how to focus
ideas, develop minimum viable products, pitch ideas to stakeholders, and collaborate as teams. This will be supported by a dedicated termly software week
with software sprints, progress talks, external seminars delivered by partners, and other activities.
